//The Merkle root is based on a tree of hashes calculated from the transactions:
//
//     root
//      / \
//   A      B
//  / \    / \
// t1 t2 t3 t4
//
// The tree is represented as a list: t1,t2,t3,t4,A,B,root where each
// entry is a hash.
//
// The hashing algorithm is double SHA-256. The leaves are a hash of the serialized contents of the transaction.
// The interior nodes are hashes of the concenation of the two child hashes.
//
// This structure allows the creation of proof that a transaction was included into a block without having to
// provide the full block contents. Instead, you can provide only a Merkle branch. For example to prove tx2 was
// in a block you can just provide tx2, the hash(tx1) and B. Now the other party has everything they need to
// derive the root, which can be checked against the block header. These proofs aren't used right now but
// will be helpful later when we want to download partial block contents.
//
// Note that if the number of transactions is not even the last tx is repeated to make it so (see
// tx3 above). A tree with 5 transactions would look like this:
//
//         root
//        /     \
//       1        5
//     /   \     / \
//    2     3    4  4
//  / \   / \   / \
// t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t5
